Managing Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All tests, independent of testing methodology or technology, should be
located in the ``/tests`` folder under the corresponding module. If there
are multiple testing methodologies for one module, for example unit
testing and integration testing, the module can contain sub-folders.
