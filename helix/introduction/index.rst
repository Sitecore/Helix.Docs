Introduction
============

*Sitecore Helix* is a collection of **recommended practices** and
**conventions** for the **solution architecture** of Sitecore product
implementations.

These practices are based on principles of **modular architecture**
(a.k.a. package design), which help you to **manage dependencies** in
your solution in a way that creates **more maintainble code**.

Application of modular architecture will **decrease the cost of change**
of your Sitecore solution and provide more long term value to your customers.

These conventions also give the Sitecore Community a **shared language**
for solution architecture, making Sitecore implementations more discoverable
for current and future developers.
