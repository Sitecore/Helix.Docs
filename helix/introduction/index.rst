Introduction
============

There are some good *overall* *design principles* that should be used
when designing any software project. One of the key principles is to be
very strict about the dependencies between software modules. This makes
the modules easier to code, test and maintain. The principles apply to
any software project in any language so they are equally applicable to
Java as they are to .NET and Sitecore.

The development guidelines and recommended practices in this documentation
describe the application of the *overall* *design principles* applied to
a Sitecore project. It says how modules should be structured and how
individual sites should use these modules. It is a set of
recommendations for making your Sitecore project as easy to create,
test, extend and maintain as possible.

*Helix* is the overall design principles and conventions for Sitecore development described in this documentation.
