Domain language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Terminology and naming is one of the hardest things to get right in
software development – and one of the biggest sources of confusion and
inefficiency.

Remember that the true users of the code you are writing are never the
developers or technical project members. The true users are the business
users, editors, administrators or visitors. Therefore, establishing a
common domain language between the developers and business users should
be a top priority in any project. Likewise, once a domain language has
been established, it is imperative that the terminology be ubiquitous.
What is even worse and more confusing than using the wrong terminology,
is using multiple terminologies at once.

.. admonition:: Habitat Example

    In Habitat *Teaser* refers to a rendering which can be used across
    different page types to highlight another type of content, for example
    *News Teaser* (highlighting and linking to a news article) or *Person
    Teaser* (relating a person to the content and linking to the person’s
    page or contact details). This concept is often known as or referred to
    as *Spots*, *Promotions* or just *Promos*. Choosing the term which the
    end users are familiar with can make the learning curve flatter and
    drive an easier adoption.

Also be cautious that terminology can be ambiguous between domains, for
example the marketing and technology domain, and a specific technical
tool can define a business domain term in another way than the common or
individual company understanding. For example, the Sitecore Experience
Platform uses the terms campaign and template in very particular ways – and
is often in conflict with the common understanding in the marketing
domain.

A close attention to terminology always increases productivity.
