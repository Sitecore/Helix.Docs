Module structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each module has the following structure:

::

    /â€¦
        /[Module Name]     // Module root folder, named after the module (without prefixes)
            /website       // Houses the website code for the module, for example the Visual Studio project with the website business logic or views.
            /serialization // Contains the serialized data from Sitecore, for example templates, content or security data
            /tests         // Unit or other test types for the module
            /engine        // Houses the code for the plugin that runs on the Commerce Engine

Note that not all modules will contain all of the elements seen above. Some of
your modules will contain functionality that only executes on the website, some 
will contain functionality that only executes on the Commerce Engine, and some 
will contain functionality that executes on both.
