Language and culture support
----------------------------

How your Sitecore implementation handles languages is largely dependent
on the business requirements, but it is recommended that you include
support for multiple languages or cultures in your modules. This not
only adds the possibility for adding more languages or cultures over
time, but also encourages good practices such as not hard coding any
content and letting an editor manage and edit all text on the website.
