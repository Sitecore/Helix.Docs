Solution structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For maximum discoverability, the structure of the Visual Studio solution
must represent the layer and module structure, i.e. have solution
folders for Project, Feature and Foundation layers and separate solution
folders for each module. If there are any additional grouping of
modules, these can have their own solution folders.
